      "description": "This document describes the API of the ecolytiq Sustainability-as-a-Service&reg; platform.\n\necolytiq has developed a method of assigning financial (bank) transactions with a CO<sub>2</sub> footprint, therefore, allowing financial institutions to inform their end customers about the ecological impact of their transactions. \nThe calculation is based on the amount of the (outgoing) transaction and a category of the transaction which are both components of various region-specific calculation models.\n\n## Basic Requirements\n\nTo use the ecolytiq platform a customer is required to have a working pair of client credentials consisting of a `client_id` and a `client_secret`.\nThose credentials are provided by ecolytiq after a contract is signed.\n\nThe customer is responsible for providing the client application that manages the integration of the ecolytiq services into their systems.\n\nCertain features may not be available to or necessary for all customers. \nHence, the set of enabled features is bound to a set of client credentials.\n\n## Information on Available and Enabled Features\n\nAs not all features may be relevant to all customers the feature set can vary for different client credentials.\nThe ecolytiq platform provides an [info API](#tag/Info-API) to get information about the features that are available (in general) and accessible/enabled (for the customer).\n\n## Processing of Financial Transactions\n\n### Transaction Enrichment\n\nThe core functionality is enriching the transactions with the ecological footprint (at present: CO<sub>2</sub>) related to the purchase. \nThis can be achieved by sending transactions to the [transaction API](#tags/Transaction-API). \n\nThe ecolytiq platform has the ability to immediately return the calculation result (\"synchronous processing\") or to only accept the transactions and schedule the calculations until a later point in time (\"asynchronous processing\").\nIn any case, the [result of the calculation](#operation/getTransactionsTransactions) can also be retrieved at a later point in time.\n\n### Refinement of Transactions\n\nIn some cases, the amount of the transaction is not a good indicator of the ecological footprint related to the transaction.\nIn such instances, the transactions can be refined by [answering transaction-specific questions](#operation/postTransactionsQuestions) (e.g., \"How many liters was your refill at the gas station?\").\n\n### Transaction Processing and Refinement Workflow\n\nA suggested workflow for processing an end customer's transaction looks as follows:\n\n1. Send the transaction to the ecolytiq service for processing:          \n   [`POST /transactions/v1/transactions`](#operation/postTransactionTransaction)\n\n2. Request a list of references to refinement questions that are available for this transaction:  \n   [`GET /transactions/v1/refinements?transaction_ids=<transaction_ids>`](#operation/getTransactionsRefinements)\n3. Retrieve the content (questions and answers) associated with the refinement question and answer IDs:          \n   [`GET /transactions/v1/questions?question_ids=<question_ids>`](#operation/getTransactionsQuestions)\n   > #### Note\n   > This step can also be executed in the very beginning by omitting the `question_ids` parameter.\n   In that case, **all available** questions are returned. \n   The result can then be cached on the client side.\n\n4. Have the end customer answer the refinement question(s):  \n   This must be handled in the client application\n\n5. Send the answers to the refinement questions to the ecolytiq platform:  \n   [`POST /transactions/v1/refinements`](#operation/postTransactionsRefinements)\n\n6. Retrieve the calculation result for the refined transaction:  \n   [`GET /transactions/v1/transactions?transaction_ids=<transaction_ids>`](#operation/getTransactionsTransactions) \n\n### Account Profiling\n\nFor some types of purchases, having additional knowledge about the end customer can be helpful. \nFor example, the supermarket shopping basket of a person regularly having meat on their plate differs from that of a vegan person. \nIt is possible to request such information for each individual transaction.\nHowever, it can be easier to attribute such information to an end customer once.\nThe [profiling API](#tag/Profiling-API) is available for this.\n\n## Educational and Informational Content\n\nAnother important feature of the ecolytiq Sustainability-as-a-Service&reg; platform is the educational content that allows end customers to gain more knowledge and awareness of the ecological footprint created by their purchase decisions.\nIn the long term informing and educating end customers about their individual impact will help make them more literate choices when consuming goods and services. \n\nAt present, ecolytiq offers the following types of content: \n\n  * **Comparables** are small examples that for a given CO<sub>2</sub> footprint show in a concrete and easily graspable way how much of an impact that is.\n\n  * **Insights** are short and simple tips and tricks that help end customers reduce their impact.\n    In combination with the [profiling API](#tag/Profiling-API), the Insights shown are even more relevant to the end customer.\n\n  * **Explanations** are content pieces that give information about the ecolytiq calculation method.\n\nThe [profiling API](#tag/Profiling-API) delivers references to the content pieces.\nUsing the [content API](#tag/Content-API) the texts of the educational and informational content pieces can be fetched in various different languages.\n\n## Use of the SaaS Platform\n\nThe ecolytiq platform is available as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution shared among different Customers and accessible via public internet. \nOther modes of access, such as VPN access or dedicated SaaS platforms may be available upon request.\n\nThe customer is required to build and maintain the client application. Operations of the ecolytiq platform are handled by ecolytiq GmbH.\n\n## Security and Data Protection\n\nWe as ecolytiq GmbH adhere to and are compliant with all relevant data protection standards, such as GDPR, ISO27001, or PCI-DSS. \nOur platforms are regularly checked for security vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, financial data contains highly sensitive information about individuals. Therefore, our customers **are not allowed** to send actual personally identifiable information to the ecolytiq SaaS platform.\nThis is especially important for account identifiers -- **Do not use actual bank account numbers or PANs** (personal account numbers, i.e., credit card numbers) as account identifiers!\n\nAccount data must be pseudonymized. We recommend using [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) as account identifiers. \nMapping the account identifier to the end customer account **must be handled on the customer client application side**.\n",

But the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is independent of whether the ticket was bought last minute or a year in advance. \nIn such cases, the transaction data can be refined by answering specific transaction-related questions, like the duration of the flight, which will in turn allow for a much more accurate calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n",

Therefore, the volume and type of fuel could be used for better calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emission related to a service station transaction.\n  * Air travel: Prices for airline tickets are dependent on the day of the flight as well as even more so on the date of purchase. Therefore, the hours of the flight give a better basis for calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for air travel.\n\nCalling this endpoint with valid transaction IDs will return a list of suitable refinement question IDs for the transactions in request.  If the question has already been answered the reference to the corresponding answer (or the value if it is not a predefined answer) will be also returned.\n> #### Note\n> Calling this endpoint returns only references to content pieces (i.e., content IDs for questions and/or answers).\n> The mapping of question IDs / answer IDs and their text representation can be obtained from the [`GET /transactions/v1/questions`](#operation/getTransactionsQuestions) endpoint",

It refines our knowledge about the user.\n- Account specific **Insights** as described in the [Content API](#tag/Content-API) can be retrieved via the profiling API.\n",
